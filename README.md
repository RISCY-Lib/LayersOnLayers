# LayersOnLayers
A example of UVM Sequence Layering using AXI-Stream

# Getting started
First to get the ```rbuild``` tool running you must source the *setup.sh* file (as shown below).

```bash
source setup.sh
```

Then create a run directory:

```bash
cd run
mkdir [RUNDIR]
cd [RUNDIR]
```

Then rbuild can be run from this directory:

```bash
rbuild --help
```
